  <!-- What is an Anagama -->
  <section>
    <h2>What Is an Anagama?</h2>
    <p>
      An <strong>anagama</strong> (穴窯) is a Japanese "cave kiln" — one of the oldest kiln
      designs in the world. It is a single-chamber structure, typically built on a hillside,
      where the fire enters at the lowest point and travels upward through a long chamber
      filled with pottery, exiting through a chimney at the far end. As the fire burns over
      days, wood ash is carried by the flame and settles on the surfaces of the pots, creating
      natural ash glazes — no applied glaze needed. The placement of each piece within the
      kiln determines what surfaces, colors, and textures it will develop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ken's kiln in Albion takes this ancient form and builds it at extraordinary scale —
      55 feet from end to end, making it the largest single-chamber wood-fired kiln in
      North America.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Albion Anagama was built in <strong>1987</strong> by Ken Shenstone and
      <strong>David Habicht</strong>. The construction materials tell a story of place:
    </p>

    <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 1rem 1.5rem; color: var(--text-light);">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        <strong>Reclaimed industrial refractory brick</strong> from the Malleable Forge —
        the former Albion Malleable Iron Company, a piece of Albion's industrial past
        repurposed for art
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        <strong>Fieldstone buttresses</strong> — local stone providing structural support
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The design blends traditional Japanese hill-climbing kiln architecture with local
      Michigan industrial heritage. It's not a replica of a Japanese kiln — it's something
      that could only exist in Albion, built from what was there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ken has built <strong>four different kilns</strong> total on the property. Artists
      from around the world come to fire their work in them. Adjacent to the kilns sits a
      <strong>4,000 square foot ceramics gallery</strong>, also built by Ken and David Habicht.

  <!-- The Firing Process -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Firing</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Sort of a subdued party atmosphere that lasts for 10 days. Conversations go on
      that people realize are going to go on for 24 hours a day. It's not uncommon
      to have an interesting conversation, go to bed, wake up eight hours later and
      that conversation is still going on.
      <cite>— Ken Shenstone</cite>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>
      The fire starts with small kindling at the front of the kiln — the lowest point.
      Over the course of 10 continuous days (a 240-hour cycle), the kiln transforms
      from a cold, dark, cave-like space to a red and glowing inferno. A river of fire
      travels from the front up through the length of the kiln and out the chimney,
      depositing ash on every pottery surface it passes.
    </p>

    <h3>Fuel</h3>
    <p>
      The kiln is fired with wood donated by Albion resident <strong>Rusty Hull</strong>,
      who receives artwork in return — a barter system that embodies the community nature
      of this project. At peak heat, the kiln consumes up to <strong>one face cord
      (4×8 feet) of wood per half hour</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>The Team</h3>
    <p>
      Roughly 12 people work round-the-clock shifts to keep the fire fed for the full
      10-day cycle. This is not a solo endeavor — it is, by necessity and by choice, a
      collaborative event. People bring meals, split wood, tend the fire, and talk.
      The conversations that start on day one don't stop until the last ember is banked.
    </p>

    <h3>After the Fire</h3>
    <p>
      When the firing ends, the kiln must cool for <strong>two full weeks</strong> before
      it can be opened. What comes out are surfaces shaped by 240 hours of flame, ash
      deposit, and atmospheric chemistry — natural ash glazes ranging from dark yellow
      with complex textures to smooth light teal, all determined by where each piece
      sat inside the kiln.
    </p>

    <p>
      After cooling and unloading, Ken hosts <strong>studio sales</strong> at the property,
      typically in autumn. Prices range from as low as $8 to hundreds — making the work
      accessible while honoring the extraordinary process behind each piece.

      In 2015–2016, photographer and filmmaker Dave Lawrence documented the firing
      process and the community around the Albion Anagama.

      In March 2022, <strong>CultureVerse</strong> — a Michigan-based non-profit — created
      Matterport 3D scans of several pieces of Ken's pottery and the large kiln in its
      entirety. The scan allows you to move through the kiln from mouth to tail — all 45
      feet of it — from your screen.

    <h2>The Other Kilns</h2>
    <p>
      The Albion Anagama is the flagship — but it's one of <strong>four kilns</strong>
      on the property. Ken also built a noborigama ("Bobo the Nobo"), a dome-tube hybrid
      of his own design, and at least one additional kiln. Each represents a different
      philosophy of fire.
