      This page isn't about ceramics. It's about a material — and the two men,
      50 miles apart in the same state, who used it to maintain fire.

  <div class="material-name">
    NARCO Ram
  </div>

  <section>
    <h2>What It Is</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>NARCO Ram</strong> is a castable refractory ramming mix made by the
      North American Refractories Company. It's a high-temperature material used to
      line and repair furnaces, boilers, kilns — anything that holds extreme heat.
      You mix it, pack it into the gaps and joints and worn places, and it cures into
      a rock-hard surface that can withstand thousands of degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's not glamorous. It's not the kind of material anyone writes about. It's
      maintenance material — the stuff that keeps the fire contained, the structure
      sound, the heat where it needs to be. The people who use it are the people who
      keep things running.

    <h2>Two Men, One Material</h2>
    <p>
      Ryan's father drove 50 miles to Zug Island to keep a boiler running.
      Ken drives nowhere — the kilns are on his property — but the work is the same
      work: maintaining the integrity of a structure that holds fire. When refractory
      degrades from thermal cycling — the endless expansion and contraction as a
      furnace heats and cools — someone has to pack the gaps, seal the joints, keep
      the heat where it belongs. That someone uses NARCO Ram.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Number Two Boiler, the fire was industrial. It made steam that made power
      that made steel. The fire was not the point; it was the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Albion, the fire <em>is</em> the point. It makes ash that makes glaze that
      makes art. The fire is not an engine — it is the artist's collaborator, the
      unpredictable partner that Ken has spent 40 years learning to work with.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the material that maintains both fires is the same. The hands that pack it
      into the joints are doing the same work. And neither man — the boiler operator
      on swing shift or the ceramic artist at his kiln — would call what he does
      anything other than necessary.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What This Is Not</h2>
    <p>
      The brick in Ken's kilns is <strong>not</strong> from Zug Island. It comes from the
      <strong>Albion Malleable Iron Company</strong> — the former "Malleable Forge," right
      there in Albion. That's a different story: local industrial heritage repurposed
      for art, Albion's past becoming Albion's present.
    </p>
    <p>
      The connection between Ken's kilns and Ryan's father is not the brick. It is the
      NARCO Ram. It is the practice of refractory maintenance — the unglamorous,
      essential work of keeping the fire contained. One man did it for industry. One
      man does it for art. They never met. They used the same material.

      This page was written by Ryan, who visited Ken's studio on the insistence of
      his friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/henrycrissman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henry Crissman</a>,
      and recognized the NARCO Ram on the kiln walls. The connection was immediate
      and personal. Not everything in a ceramic legacy is about ceramics.
