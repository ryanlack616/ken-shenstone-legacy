      The <a href="kiln.html">55-foot Albion Anagama</a> gets the headlines. But Ken
      has built <strong>four different kilns</strong> on the property at 29005 Albion Road.
      Each one embodies a different approach to fire, heat, and time. Where the anagama
      is a single chamber that takes 10 days and a crew of 12, the other kilns are smaller,
      faster, and — in the case of the noborigama — rooted in a different Japanese tradition
      entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they make the studio one of the most versatile wood-firing sites in
      the country — and one of the reasons artists travel from around the world to fire here.

    <h3>What Is a Noborigama?</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>noborigama</strong> (登り窯) is a Japanese "climbing kiln" — a multi-chamber
      structure built on an incline. The firebox sits at the lowest point. Heat and flame
      rise through connected chambers, each at a higher elevation than the last. Each chamber
      reaches a different temperature, giving the potter distinct firing zones in a single
      firing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the anagama is one enormous room through which flame travels 55 feet, the
      noborigama is a series of connected rooms, each with its own character. It's a
      fundamentally different philosophy: instead of one vast atmospheric space, the potter
      works with graduated zones.
    </p>

    <h3>Bobo the Nobo</h3>
    <p>
      Ken's noborigama — affectionately nicknamed <strong>"Bobo the Nobo"</strong> by the studio
      community — has been firing since at least 2011. Unlike the anagama's 10-day marathons,
      Bobo runs on a Friday-to-Sunday cycle: roughly three days of continuous firing.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Next firing in Bobo the nobo will begin Friday the 27th and finish Sunday the 29th.
      This firing will include lots of running through the sprinkler and maybe horse trough
      to dip in. Anagama scheduled for Halloween.
      <cite>— Ken Shenstone, Facebook</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      From Facebook, we see the noborigama has been fired many times over the years — for
      Mother's Day sales, summer events, holiday seasons. The pieces from the nobo are
      distinct from anagama pieces: different ash patterns, different atmospheric conditions,
      different relationship between flame and clay.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      The Nobo reached desired temperature and will be opened on Saturday!
      <cite>— Ken Shenstone, November 8, 2011</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>The Firing Logs</h3>
    <p>
      Ken keeps <strong>handwritten firing schedule books</strong> for the noborigama —
      detailed records of each firing's temperature curves, timing, fuel consumption, and
      results. These logs represent decades of accumulated knowledge about how this
      specific kiln behaves in this specific environment. They are, to our knowledge,
      undigitized.

        <div class="fact-label">Ken's Own Design</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      In early 2018, Ken was building again. Construction photos from January and February
      of that year show brickwork rising, materials staged, and a nighttime test fire — flames
      visible through the chamber openings under floodlights. By spring 2018 or 2019, the
      new kiln was finished and firing.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      The third firing of the new kiln is unloaded. Come see what we have created!
      <cite>— Ken Shenstone, Facebook, ~2019</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      A community member, Karen Baker, asked: <em>"Ken, are you no longer firing the kiln
      that was up towards the house? Is this the new kiln?"</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ken's reply: <em>"Haven't fired in few years. Finish this new kiln last spring. This is
      third firing. Not to say we won't fire the b[ig one]…"</em>
    </p>

    <h3>The Design</h3>
    <p>
      Photo analysis of 43 images from the kiln site reveals a structure unlike any
      standard kiln form. It appears to be a <strong>dome-tube hybrid</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 1rem 1.5rem; color: var(--text-light);">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        A <strong>dome section</strong> (~15 feet in diameter) — semi-spherical with an
        arched loading door and stoke holes along the perimeter
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        A <strong>tube section</strong> (~35 feet long) extending from the dome — with
        additional stoke holes and spy holes along its length
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        The dome provides <strong>even radiant heat distribution</strong>; the tube provides
        <strong>directional flame wash</strong> — combining two thermal philosophies in one structure
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is not a standard form from any kiln-building tradition. It's Ken's own
      engineering — a solution that could only come from someone who has spent decades
      building and firing different kilns, understanding each approach's strengths,
      and then synthesizing them.
    </p>

    <h3>Construction</h3>
    <p>
      Like all the kilns on the property, the dome-tube hybrid is built from
      <strong>reclaimed industrial refractory brick from the Albion Malleable Iron Company</strong>
      — the same source that provided the material for the original anagama in 1987.
      The bricks show varying colors from their different industrial histories before reuse.
      Stone blocks form the base, clay-based mortar fills the joints, and metal clamps
      reinforce the arch and loading door.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>NARCO Ram</strong> — a high-temperature castable refractory — is used at the
      dome-to-tube transition zone, at joint repairs, and around the stoke holes.
      It's the same material used for maintaining industrial furnace linings, repurposed
      here for kiln maintenance.

  <!-- The Fourth Kiln -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Fourth Kiln</h2>
    <p>
      Ken's studio property has <strong>four kilns total</strong>. We can identify three
      wood-fired kilns from available evidence: the 55-foot anagama, the noborigama,
      and the dome-tube hybrid. The fourth may be one of the gas or electric kilns
      referenced in the studio's resident artist posting:
    </p>
    <blockquote style="border-left-color: var(--ash);">
      24-hour studio access including slab roller, multiple wheels, extruder,
      gas, electric, and wood kilns, clay mixer…
      <cite>— Resident Artist posting, 2015</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Or it may be another wood-fired kiln not yet documented. If you know more about
      Ken's kilns, please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>.

  <!-- Two Philosophies -->
  <section>
    <h2>Two Philosophies of Fire</h2>
    <p>
      Having multiple kilns isn't just about capacity — it's about choice. Each kiln
      creates different conditions for the clay:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 1rem 1.5rem; color: var(--text-light);">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        <strong>The Anagama</strong>: 10 days, one enormous chamber, 55 feet of flame path.
        Maximum ash deposit, maximum atmospheric complexity. The iconic firings.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        <strong>The Noborigama</strong>: 3 days, multiple connected chambers, gravity-assisted
        draft. Different temperature zones, chamber-by-chamber loading. Faster turnaround.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        <strong>The Dome-Tube</strong>: Ken's hybrid — radiant dome heat combined with
        directional tube flame. His own engineering, informed by decades of kiln building.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      From Facebook, we see Ken alternating between them — firing the nobo for spring and
      summer sales, the anagama for the big autumn firing, the new kiln when the mood or
      the work calls for it. The choice of kiln is part of the artistic decision. Where you
      fire changes what you make.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Workshop -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Workshop</h2>
    <p>
      All the kilns sit within a large pole barn that doubles as a community space.
      Photos show seating areas with sofas and tables, string lights for atmosphere,
      wood storage racks along the walls, and workshop infrastructure — a cement mixer,
      welding equipment, oxygen cylinders, tools. Everything needed to build and maintain
      the kilns is on-site. Ken is self-sufficient: he built the kilns, the studio, the
      gallery, even the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pole barn is where the 10-day conversations happen. Where meals are shared
      during firings. Where apprentices learn and visitors stand in awe of the heat
      pouring from a stoke hole at 2,400 degrees. It's a workspace and a gathering place —
      as Ken put it, <em>"sort of a subdued party atmosphere."</em>
