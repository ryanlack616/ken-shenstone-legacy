    <p>
      Ken Shenstone is a ceramic artist based in Albion, Michigan. A graduate of
      <strong>Albion College</strong>, he has spent nearly four decades building kilns,
      throwing pots, and tending fires — creating a body of wood-fired work shaped
      as much by the unpredictable forces of flame and ash as by his own hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ken is not just a potter. He is a master kiln builder — having constructed four
      different kilns on his property, including the <a href="kiln.html">largest
      single-chamber wood-fired kiln in North America</a>. He is also a woodworker
      who built his own studio, including making and installing the windows. The phrase
      "Renaissance man" gets overused, but when you're building your own kilns, your
      own studio, your own windows, and then filling all of it with pottery you made
      from clay you fired with wood — it fits.
    </p>

  <!-- Artist Statement -->
  <section>
    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Though not random, surfaces and even changes to the form are unpredictable.
      The best results are often unplanned.
      <cite>— Ken Shenstone</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This single statement encapsulates decades of practice. In wood firing, the potter
      controls what can be controlled — the form on the wheel, the placement in the kiln,
      the feeding of the fire — and then surrenders to what cannot be controlled. Where the
      ash lands, how the flame wraps around a surface, what chemistry emerges from the
      interaction of fire, wood, and earth over 240 continuous hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result is work that carries the signature of the kiln itself: natural ash glazes
      that range from dark yellow with complex textures to smooth light teal, depending
      on nothing more than where a piece sat inside 55 feet of fire.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Philosophy -->
  <section>
    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Wood ash settles on the pottery during the firing, and the complex interaction
      between flame, ash and clay forms a natural ash glaze. Just like life, it's
      unpredictable. One piece can come out dark yellow, with a variety of textures,
      while another will end up with a smooth light teal finish, depending on its placement.
      <cite>— Ken Shenstone</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This philosophy — embracing unpredictability as a feature rather than fighting it —
      runs through everything Ken does. The anagama kiln is a collaboration between the
      potter and the fire. You can spend a lifetime learning what the fire tends to do,
      but each firing teaches you something new.
    </p>

  <!-- Skills & Practice -->
  <section>
    <h2>Skills &amp; Practice</h2>

    <h3>Ceramics</h3>
    <p>
      Ken's work spans a range of functional and sculptural forms:
      teabowls, bud vases, lidded jars, flower vases, flip top bottles,
      scrolls, peanut vessels, and moon jars. Each form is thrown on the wheel
      and finished exclusively through wood firing — no applied glazes, no
      commercial kiln atmosphere. The surfaces come from the kiln alone.
    </p>

    <h3>Kiln Building</h3>
    <p>
      Over the decades, Ken has built four different kilns on his Albion property.
      The most significant — the Albion Anagama — was constructed in 1987 from
      reclaimed refractory brick salvaged from the Malleable Forge, the former
      Albion Malleable Iron Company. The design blends traditional Japanese
      hill-climbing kiln architecture with local industrial materials, creating
      something that is both rooted in ancient tradition and distinctly Michigander.
    </p>

    <h3>Woodworking &amp; Construction</h3>
    <p>
      Ken built his studio by hand, including crafting and installing the windows.
      He also constructed a 4,000 square foot ceramics gallery on the property
      with David Habicht. This is not a potter who outsources — it's a self-built
      world where every structure serves the work.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Teaching & Demonstrations -->
  <section>
    <h2>Teaching &amp; Community</h2>
    <p>
      Ken regularly demonstrates wheel throwing at public events, including the
      Chelsea Sounds &amp; Sights Festival Art Market and the French Market, where
      he engages young people with hands-on ceramic work. His studio hosts a
      <strong>Resident Artist program</strong> and <strong>apprenticeships</strong>,
      and his firings are collaborative events open to visiting artists from
      around the world.
