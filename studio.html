  <!-- The Collaborative Nature -->
  <section>
    <h2>A Collaborative Fire</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Sort of a subdued party atmosphere that lasts for 10 days. Conversations go on
      that people realize are going to go on for 24 hours a day. It's not uncommon
      to have an interesting conversation, go to bed, wake up eight hours later and
      that conversation is still going on.
      <cite>— Ken Shenstone</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The Albion Anagama is not — and has never been — a solo project. A 10-day
      continuous firing requires roughly 12 people working in shifts, feeding the fire
      around the clock, bringing meals, splitting wood, supervising the temperature,
      and keeping each other company through long nights lit by the glow from the kiln
      mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
      This collaborative nature is not accidental. The kiln is designed to require
      community. Other artists bring meals, split wood, or help supervise the fire in
      return for space in the kiln for their own work. What stays consistent across
      nearly 40 years is the need to work together and the energy that surrounds each
      firing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Artists from around the world have fired their work in Ken's kilns. The studio
      at 29005 Albion Road is a destination for potters who want to understand wood
      firing at a scale few other places in the world can offer.

  <!-- Programs -->
  <section>
    <h2>Programs</h2>

    <h3>Resident Artist</h3>
    <p>
      Ken's studio hosts a resident artist program, offering potters the chance to
      work alongside a master and fire in kilns that most people only read about.
      Living and working on the property means immersion in the daily rhythms of a
      working ceramic studio — from morning throwing sessions to preparing for the
      next firing.
    </p>

    <h3>Apprenticeships</h3>
    <p>
      For those looking to learn deeply, Ken offers apprenticeship positions.
      As recently as September 2025, he was posting to ceramics communities:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Woodfire!!! Sometimes opportunities come along that will change your life forever.
      This is your opportunity to really learn to understand...
      <cite>— Ken Shenstone, September 2025, Pots by Potters</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The Wild Clay Pottery community described the opportunity as a chance to
      "work in one of the top ranked wood-fire centers in the world."
    </p>

    <h3>Community Firings</h3>
    <p>
      The firings are open to visiting artists. Bring meals, split wood, help
      supervise the fire — and earn space in the kiln for your own work. This is how
      the kiln has always operated: as a shared resource, powered by collective effort.
    </p>

    <p>
      The studio at 29005 Albion Road is more than a workspace — it's a compound
      Ken built for the work. He constructed the studio building himself, including
      crafting and installing the windows. The property includes:

    <h2>Documentary</h2>
    <p>
      In fall 2015 through 2016, photographer Dave Lawrence captured the life of the
      studio and the intensity of the firing process in his short documentary,
      <em>Albion Anagama</em>.
